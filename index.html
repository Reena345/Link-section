        <h1>Google</h1>
        <p>Google is a multinational technology company specializing in internet-related services and products. Founded in 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at Stanford University, Google quickly rose to prominence with its search engine, which revolutionized the way people access information online.
        Over the years, Google has expanded its offerings to include a wide range of products and services, including advertising services, cloud computing, software, hardware, and more. Some of its notable products and services include Google Search, Gmail, Google Maps, YouTube, Google Drive, Android operating system, and the Google Chrome web browser.
        Google's mission is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. The company's core values include a focus on innovation, user experience, and a commitment to providing relevant and high-quality information to users.
        In addition to its core products, Google has also ventured into areas such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, autonomous vehicles (through its subsidiary Waymo), healthcare, and renewable energy.
        Google is headquartered in Mountain View, California, and operates offices and data centers around the world. As of my last update in January 2022, Google continues to be one of the most influential and valuable technology companies globally, with a significant impact on how people interact with the internet and technology in general.</p>
